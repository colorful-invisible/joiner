# Project general coding standards

## Prompt Conventions

- DCY: Don't code yet. Do not change the code unless explicitly asked. Give ideas or suggestions instead.

## Error Handling

- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Always log errors with contextual information
